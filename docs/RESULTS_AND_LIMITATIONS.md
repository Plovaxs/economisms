# Results, including negative findings, and known limits

This project's evidence discipline (README.md § The evidence discipline)
applies here too: this page reports what the comparisons in this
repository actually found, including every time a headline hypothesis did
**not** hold up, not just the results that look good. Every number below
has a corresponding test/run in this repository — see
[docs/PR_LEDGER.md](./PR_LEDGER.md) for the full PR-by-PR account each
summary is drawn from.

## The overall gate decision: NO-GO

[`evidence/gate_report_r0.json`](../evidence/gate_report_r0.json) is this
project's own, unchanged internal release gate decision: **NO-GO for
production.** Nothing in this repository is financial advice, a trading
system, or infrastructure for live trading (see
[README.md § Status & disclaimers](../README.md#status--disclaimers)). This
is the single most important "result" on this page, and it is stated here
precisely so it cannot be missed by skimming only the model-comparison
sections below.

## Finding 1 (PR-142): a fixed-epoch training budget had been silently favoring the simpler model

A diagnostic trace of RECESSIONNET's original fixed-epoch comparison
(PR-139) found the higher-capacity hybrid-quantum and classical-MLP
candidates (493 parameters) overfitting past epoch ~20-60, while 25-parameter
logistic regression did not — the comparison had been unfair the entire
time, not because of anything quantum-specific (no vanishing-gradient
plateau was observed; training loss fell smoothly the whole run), but
because nothing was controlling for capacity. Moving to validation-selected
early stopping **reversed the previously reported qualitative finding**:
real seed=0 result, quantum Brier score (~0.087) landed close to its best
classical challenger's (~0.083), and 4 of 5 seeds checked by hand were
statistically inconclusive rather than showing a robust quantum advantage.
**Limitation:** this is a small (few-hundred-to-low-thousands row) monthly
dataset; "inconclusive at 5 seeds" is an honest report of low statistical
power on this sample size, not evidence of equivalence.

## Finding 2 (PR-143): no classical/quantum regression gap either, once methodology was fixed from the start

Q-MACRO compared AR(3) (genuinely refit at every real test month, not
frozen), a classical MLP, and a hybrid quantum regressor for h-months-ahead
Mkt-RF prediction, using PR-142's early-stopping methodology from the
outset. Real result: all three learned/refit approaches landed within a
tight band (MAE ≈ 0.034, MASE ≈ 0.62), clearly ahead of naive persistence
(MASE ≈ 0.89) — but with **no significant difference among AR(3), MLP, and
the hybrid quantum model** across 5 seeds checked. The honest reading: the
hard part of this problem is beating persistence at all; once a model does
that, architecture (including "hybrid quantum") did not matter on this
data. **Limitation:** same small-sample caveat as Finding 1; this is not a
claim that no architecture could ever matter on a larger or different
dataset.

## Finding 3 (PR-145): on a second, independently-sourced real dataset, the simplest baseline won outright

RECESSIONNET re-run on real Kaggle-sourced U.S. GDP/claims/Fed-funds/M2/
NASDAQ data (a different real-data source than PR-139's original factor
data) found the **base rate** — not logistic regression, not either neural
candidate — was the strongest classical candidate on this dataset/split,
with quantum again showing no significant difference against it.
**Limitation:** a base rate winning is itself informative about how hard
(or how class-imbalanced) this particular prediction task is on this
particular dataset; it is reported here exactly because it's an
unflattering result for every model that took more effort to build, not
despite that.

## Finding 4 (PR-146): real market events used as correctness checks, not just backtests

The Treasury yield-curve connector's test suite deliberately checks the
ingested data against two real, independently verifiable historical
events rather than only internal consistency: the genuine 2-year/10-year
yield curve inversion on 2006-08-25 (4.86% vs 4.79%, preceding the 2008
recession) and the 3-month T-bill rate falling to exactly 0.00% during the
March 2020 COVID shock. A third real event (2020-04-10, Good Friday) is
used as a *discriminating* test case for the holiday-detection logic
specifically because it is a bond-market closure that is **not** a federal
holiday — proving the detection is derived from real data gaps rather than
copied from a wrong, generic federal-holiday list.

## Known limitations that are not findings, just open scope

- **No neural-SDE or PDE/BSDE-based pricing model existed in this
  repository as of PR-146** — closed-form and Monte Carlo pricers only
  (`prometheus.volterra`). See `CHECKLIST_STATUS.md`'s `NSD`/`PDE`
  categories for current status.
- **No multi-agent reinforcement-learning policy exists** (`MAR` category)
  — the economy's household/firm/bank/government agents use the
  deterministic/calibrated policies described in `prometheus.econosim`,
  not learned RL policies.
- **No product-facing dashboard UI exists** (`UIX` category) — the
  [ECONOSIM Blueprint Coverage dashboard](https://claude.ai/artifact/HChLfAPJQfvUasBbLP4fxj)
  referenced in recent PR narratives is a project-status visualization
  artifact, not an in-product UI for the research platform itself.
- **No independent human review of any claim in this repository has
  happened.** "Evidenced" means covered by a passing automated test here —
  not peer-reviewed, not regulator-approved, not production-ready. See
  `GOV`, `SEC`, and `LCH` categories in `CHECKLIST_STATUS.md` for exactly
  which sign-offs remain open and why they need real organizational
  authority this repository's source tree cannot itself provide.
